# bookmarks (project)

## Week four - web app with database

### Monday 9 Mar 2020 with James

#### User story

```
As a user
So that I can access my favourite websites
I would like to see a list of bokmarks
```

Start by setting up project. Used guidance from Makers "The Ruby Web Project Setup List", and James.

End of step 2 - we have now created a test page and a homepage, both with appropriate text and passing tests.

End of step 3 - a bit of a wild refactor. (got there by following the Walkthrough). Need to read more about MVC model. Try to figure out what is going on with the `self.all` method.
